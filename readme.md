# BuildPal (Backend Practice)

This is a practice project to get better at building backend APIs with Express and MongoDB.

### Features so far:
- Create a challenge with your name and idea
- Share link with a second person to join the same challenge
- Store both users and their challenge in MongoDB

Not production-ready. Just building to learn and get sharper with backend logic and data modeling.
